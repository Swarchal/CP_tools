## TODO

- [ ] re-write `make_LoadData/src/reshape.R` in python
- [ ] ability to merge additional Metadata based on well and plate
- [ ] Have a metadata image URL so we have the possibility to link images to datapoints
- [ ] See if there are any quicker ways than using `find`, as this is quite slow for large directories.
