All .csv files should have the same columns and column positions.
So should be able to strip the first two lines from each file and use cat
to merge them all together.

Might need to use find -f and grep to select only the DATA.csv files, and then
loop through those files using head or tail to remove the first two lines and
send all output to append to a single file. Then add the first two lines of 
columns names to the beginning of the file. This might not even require loading
the entire dataset into memory at once.
